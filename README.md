A smart AI assistant which does all the work in just one single command.
I've used Deep Learning and Neural Networking for training the software.
The main motive of this undergoing project is to make a replica of JARVIS, and achieve what all it could do.

The Project is yet under progress and would be a major one as well as it would also include Automation of Hardware objects as well!
After the project completion I would be able to control the activities in my enviroment with my single command be it software based or hardware.
